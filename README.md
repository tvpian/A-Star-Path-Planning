# ENPM 661 - Project 3 - Phase 2

## Team Members
* Abhijay (UID - 118592619)
* Tharun Puthanveettil (UID - 119069516)

## Dependencies

* python3 interpreter
* Python packages - numpy, time, matplotlib, copy, math, collections, queue, opencv, readline
* ROS - noetic, turtlebot3(needs to be installed), gazebo_ros

## Execution

* **Part 01 - A\* Solver** 
    
    - To execute the program for this problem, navigate to the submission folder and use the following commands
        ```
        cd <path_to_submission>/code/
        python3 a_star_Abhijay_Tharun.py
        ```

    - Once you run the program, enter the start and goal states in the format shown below:
        ```
        Enter start state (x y theta) : 50 100 0
        Enter end state (x y) : 300 180
        Enter clearance (clearance) : 5
        Enter RPM1 and RPM2 (RPM1, RPM2) : 30 60
        ```

    - Each line of input should be in the format x y theta where x, y and theta are the x and y coordinates of the point and theta is the orientation of the robot respectively.

    - The program will not run if only one of the coordinates is entered or if the coordinates are not integers.

    - The program will not run if the clearance and radius are not entered in the format clearance, radius.

* **Part 02 - ROS**

    - Build the ROS package using the following command:
        ```
        catkin_make
        ```
    - Source the ROS workspace using the following command:
        ```
        source devel/setup.bash
        ```
    
    - Enter the following command to launch the ROS node:
        ```
        roslaunch a_star_solver astar_map.launch
        ```

    - If the roslaunch command doesn't work then navigate to the launch folder in the submission folder and use the following command:
        ```
        roslaunch astar_map.launch
        ```

    - Press the enter key once to display the options for the program.

    - Once you run the program, enter the start and goal states in the format shown below:
        ```
        Enter start state (x y theta) : 0 0 0
        Enter end state (x y) : 5 0
        Enter clearance (clearance) : 5
        Enter RPM1 and RPM2 (RPM1, RPM2) : 30 60
        ```
    - The inputs for the coordinates should be with respect to the Gazebo world frame. 

## Results
* **A\* Solver** 
    
    - The outputs is as shown below:
        ```
        Enter start state (x y theta) : 50 100 0
        Enter end state (x y) : 300 180
        Enter clearance (clearance) : 5
        Enter RPM1 and RPM2 (RPM1, RPM2) : 30 60
